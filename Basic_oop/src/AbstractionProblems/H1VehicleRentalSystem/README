📘 Vehicle Rental System — Review Summary

This project demonstrates a solid understanding of abstraction, polymorphism, and the Template Method pattern. The system models vehicles, add-ons, discounts, and rental pricing in an extensible and object-oriented way.

⭐ Overall Rating: 8.2 / 10

A well-structured and extensible design with strong use of abstraction and clean separation of responsibilities. Several improvements will bring it to a professional level.

✅ Strengths

Clear abstraction of Vehicle, AddOn, Discount, and RentalService

Good polymorphic behavior across multiple vehicle types

Extensible add-on and discount system

Clean object modeling (BaseAmount, Discount breakdowns, RentalQuote)

Readable and maintainable code structure

Demonstrates Template Method-like processing in RentalService

⚠️ Key Issues Identified
1. Wrong discount calculation

Discounts are added to the subtotal instead of being subtracted.

2. Incomplete VehicleSpecific discount implementation

Method is cut off and logic is incomplete.

3. Incorrect or missing constructors in add-ons

Classes like GPS, ChildSeat, and Insurance require proper constructors.

4. Public fields in some vehicle classes

Fields such as seats and isLuxury should be private with getters.

5. TAX constant misspelled as TEX
6. RentalQuote stores numerical values as strings

Should use numeric types (double) and separate breakdown formatting.

7. Breakdown formatting issues

Add-on breakdowns run together without new lines.

🔧 Recommended Improvements

Correct discount logic (subtotal -= discountAmount)

Complete the VehicleSpecific discount code

Add proper constructors for add-ons and remove hidden/private ones

Make all fields private and properly encapsulated

Fix TEX → TAX

Use numeric fields in RentalQuote and generate breakdown strings separately

Ensure add-on breakdown has clean formatting ("\n" separators)

Improve validation and masking logic where applicable

🏆 Final Evaluation

This is a strong project showcasing advanced OOP concepts. With the recommended corrections, it can be taken to a professional, production-ready level. The architecture is flexible enough to support additional vehicles, pricing rules, and rental behaviors with minimal code changes.
